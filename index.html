I am a research fellow at <a href="https://cde.nus.edu.sg/dbe/">National University of Singapore</a>, working in the <a href="https://ideaslab.io/"> the Lab of Integrated Data, Energy Analysis + Simulation (IDEAS)</a>, led by <a href="https://cde.nus.edu.sg/dbe/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2023/02/Staff-Resume-Dr-Adrian-Chong.pdf">Dr. Adrian Chong</a>. My work is centered around buildings, where we spend over 90% of our daily lives. Pursuing a more intelligent and energy-efficient built environment, my research interest lies in the intersection of building science and cutting-edge computational technology, including machine learning, physics-based simulation, and optimization. <a href="/aboutme">[More about me]</a><br>
