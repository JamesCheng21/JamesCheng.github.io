I attended <a href='https://gyss.nrf.gov.sg/'>GYSS 2023</a> and presented my poster on <a href='/assets/pdf/gyss.pdf'>active learning assisted digital twin calibration<a/>, where I showed how the uncertainty in training data affect the calibration and proposed an active-learning based framework to facilitate the fir-for-purpose data acquisition.
